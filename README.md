# Assessing-Damage-to-Protected-Lands-due-to-Conflict

The Russian invasion of Ukraine has inflicted severe damage upon the country's ecosystems and protected lands. Trench digging, exploded munitions, and abandoned military vehicles, artillery shells, and equipment have left these lands deeply scarred, polluting the environment with hazardous materials and disrupting delicate ecosystems.  Yet, due to the ongoing hostilities, accurate and comprehensive evaluations of the environmental impact remain elusive, and it remains exceedingly difficult to deploy human resources on the ground to conduct thorough assessments of the damage in person. The goal of this project was to use open-source data and Remote Sensing techniques to analyze some of the damage done to protected lands in Ukraine caused by the war.
